/// Variables:


x := 6; // int

y := "test"; // string

z := Vector2{ 5, 5 }; // Own types using struct

// ^ those were variables that automatically declare value type, you can otherwise define them yourselves:

x: int = 6;

y: string = "test"; // char* not accepted, though pointers exist ðŸ˜Ž

z: Vector2 = Vector2{ 5, 5 };


// You can always make a variable with a manually defined type, the value can be just defined in curly brackets and not have the class/type name before them, like in C++, like this:

// no need to do this:

z: Vector2 = Vector2(5, 5);

// but like this ðŸ˜€:

z: Vector2 = { 5, 5 };

// As the type is manually defined, it just finds the appropriate constructor to the number of values give in curly brackets.

// In Rain, we don't use classes anymore, but structs:
