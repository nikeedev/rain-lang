## Why did i want to create "Rain"?

I want to create a **game programming language** for there is just not one specifically for game development in mind out there today.

My goal is to create a fast and better language for building games and apps in general (but mostly games ðŸ˜ƒ).

The goal of the language is to make programming understandable, fun and useful, especially its syntax.

**Files in [`src/`](src/) folder are not intended to be used yet**, as currently the language provides only a lexer (soon a parser will also be available).

Here is the syntax I'm thinking to implement, of course that would happen far in the future: [language_syntax file](language_syntax.md).

## Compiler info:

The programming language will possibly compile to C code to increase compatibility of devices and to use most amount of features and make it possible to add own. v

Using C, you can implement any possible library, all from OpenGL, raylib, sqlite, and etc. This gives a huge possibility to do and use whatever library you want, with a syntax so good, you won't regret choosing Rain.
