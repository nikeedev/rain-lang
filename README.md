## Why do i want to create programming language?

I want to create a **game programming language** for there is just not one specifically for game development in mind out there today.

There are languages like Jai that are in development but Jonathan (main creator of Jai) wanted to keep the language private in closed beta for now until it's perfect to be released. I want to do so too, but the idea of the **syntax will be open for everyone**.

My goal is to create a fast and better language for building games and apps in general (but mostly games :).

**Files in [`src/`](src/) folder are not intended to be used for now**, it was used before for testing lexing of the language.

BTW, here is the syntax i'm thinking to implement, of course that would happen far far in the future: [main.rain file](test/main.rain).
